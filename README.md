# CMPT-2400 – ML-Ready Dataset for Environmental Impact Prediction

Project Goal
Predict the proportion of pollutant releases to disposals in 2023 using historical environmental data (2000–2022) from the NPRI (National Pollutant Release Inventory).

About the Data
- Two datasets: `Releases` and `Disposals`, spanning over two decades  
- Contains pollutant types, quantities, release methods, and facility info  
- Data sourced from [Government of Canada NPRI](https://pollution-waste.canada.ca/national-release-inventory/)

Steps Completed
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Data cleaning: duplicates, outliers, unit conversions  
- Feature engineering: created release/disposal ratios  
- Dataset alignment and merging  
- Normalization and model selection  
- Regression modeling using:  
  - Decision Tree  
  - Logistic Regression  
  - Random Forest  
  - Gradient Boosting

Outcome
Analyzed trends showing improved waste management over time. Created predictive models to estimate future disposal behavior based on historical patterns.
